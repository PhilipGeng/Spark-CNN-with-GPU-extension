# Spark-CNN-with-GPU-extension
This is a CNN library working on CPU cluster (Spark) or GPU (JCuda) on JVM. The project is extended from my previous work
<h5>Use language:</h5>
Spark (scala api)<br>
JCuda (scala) <br>
<h5>Based on theory:</h5>
Convolutional neural network trained with back propagation algorithm using gradient descent (parameter: learning rate and momentum).<br>
Global training setting: batch training size, training mode(update weight when classification is wrong or not?)
<h5>Supervised by:</h5>
